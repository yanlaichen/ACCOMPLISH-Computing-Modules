# ODE Solver GUI

The goal of this module is to finish building a graphical user interface (GUI) MATLAB to solve initial value problems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

See instructions [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yanlaichen/ACCOMPLISH-Computing-Modules/blob/main/ODE_GUI/GUI_ODE_solver_guide.html) and then follow the materials listed below.
