# This module was created by Dr. Scott Field of UMass Dartmouth, and can be adopted in the following courses
(*) MTH 280 - Introduction to Scientific Computation
(*) MTH 361/362 - Numerical Analysis

Python is the most popular programming language and has found widespread use across science and engineering. Git is a software development tool that is widely used in industry and academia. Basic knowledge of the command-line is essential in all forms of scientific computing.

This module can be used to help students setup their computers to use Python and Git, while providing some exposure to the command-line. It's intended for students who have never used Python or Git, but could be helpful for students of all levels. The instructions are applicable for Linux, MacOS, and Windows operating systems. 

The following steps are suggested for deploying this module. The instructions assume the instructor already has basic familiarity with python, git, anaconda, and using the command line.

# Step 1: Discussion of operating systems 

(*) Students should be made aware that there are three main flavors of operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and that some minor differences in conventions exist among them.
(*) Provide students with the document OperatingSystems-WindowsUsers.pdf. This is especially important for Windows users.
  (*) Installation instructions for Windows users can be found by viewing the following video created specifically for this module: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JJWJXrLF0A

# Step 2: Installing Anaconda

Suggest that students install Python using Anaconda. The following points should be mentioned:

(*) Anaconda is a package manager (like an app store) and a computational programming environment for Python. Python and many other essential programs (e.g. spyder) will be installed
(*) Automatically handles dependencies across platforms
(*) Please install (very easy) the 64-bit option (Python 3): https://www.continuum.io/downloads

# Step 3: Installing Git

(*) MacOS and Linux users should do
  (1) search for the "terminal" program and open it up
  (2) from the command-line, run "conda install git"
(*) Windows users: follow the handout OperatingSystems-WindowsUsers.pdf (which points to a video to show these steps)

# Step 4: Computational lab/handout (checking the installation)

The computing lab was run as an in-class, hands-on activity. The exact lab given in class is provided. A few things to keep in mind

(*) A portion of the lab involves students cloning a git repo and pushing back to it. This would require the instructor to setup a git project before the lab and giving the student read/write permissions. Alternatively, these parts could be skipped. 
(*) Before running this lab, the instructor should give a brief introduction to using the command line.
