As of 2022, the following UMass Dartmouth faculty contributed to the development of these modules
- [Dr. Zheng Chen](https://lesliechenz.github.io/webpage/)
  - **Numerical Integration**. Building a graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB to approximate integrations with integrand and numerical methods as user inputs.
- [Dr. Scott Field](http://www.math.umassd.edu/~sfield/)
  - **Python and Git Setup**. Helping students setup their computers to use Python and Git, while providing some exposure to the command-line. It’s intended for students who have never used Python or Git, but could be helpful for students of all levels. The instructions are applicable for Linux, MacOS, and Windows operating systems.
- [Dr. Bob Fisher](https://rfisher.sites.umassd.edu/)
  - **Algorithmic Thinking**. A gentle introduction to algorithmic thinking, with an application to projectile motion.
- [Dr. Adam Hausknecht](http://www.math.umassd.edu/~ahausknecht/)
  - **Tangent Approximation**. Methods for approximating the tangent to the graph of a function.
- [Dr. Maricris Mayes](https://www.maricrismayes.com/)
  - **Atomic/Molecular Orbital Visualization**. Plotting the wavefunction for the particle in a box and their corresponding probability densities.

We acknowledge the National Science Foundation whose grant [DUE-2030552](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2030552&HistoricalAwards=false) initiated the program.
